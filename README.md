Currently, this project is just exploring an idea that came to me about applying
Test-Driven Development to learning foreign languages. There's no explanation,
support, or even good software design right now, because maybe I'll discover
after a little bit of experimentation that it's not as good an idea in practice
as in theory. ;)
